smart contract integration uses NEAR’s robust protocol. 

LNDA is used for purchasing land and digital assets. Soon, LNDA will be
tradable on trusted exchanges and in the Landian virtual Metaverse.`,

		title: 'LNDA Token-omics',
		description: `
Built on the Binance Smart chain, LNDA undergoes multiple levels of verification.

LNDA functions in several ways. For example, parent holders can transfer LNDA with
adjusted payouts or royalties. Furthermore, tokens change and stimulate the
performance of a specific piece.

In addition, LNDA can be used to purchase LAND. LAND is an NFT (non-fungible
token) with a unique token ID and built-in contract components.

An 80% community coin allocation took place recently across regulated platforms.
These allocations occurred at various marketing events, including the pre-initial
investor’s phase, a public sale, and an initial exchange offering (IEO). Ultimately, 
less than one percent of tokens, with restrictions, were made available for 
private sale. Today, there are abundant reserves for the launch and
development of virtual and physical Landian Cafés worldwide. Moreover, 
initial resources continue to fund the development 
of platforms and venues within Landian.

	circulation: {
		title: 'LNDA Token Circulation',
		description: `
Landian’s token supply totals 10 billion LNDA. Currently, circulation is at less
than one percent.

LNDA token allocation takes place across four tiers. That means, as one tier
opens, a corresponding portion of LNDA tokens are released. The same occurs
when another tier opens, and so on.  Most importantly, tokens are removed
from circulation and returned to reserves as plots of land are sold.

New LNDA tokens only come online to unlock a new zone after previously
zones in open districts are sold and developed.
